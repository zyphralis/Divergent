# Divergent

Divergent is an application for creating and managing Discord bots with a clean, minimal, Nothing-inspired design.

## What this repository includes

A runnable full-stack prototype of the Divergent flow:

- Bot token verification via API.
- Setup path selection (templates or custom).
- Template catalog (moderation, welcome, utility, event).
- Live dashboard data from server state.
- Sandbox test and one-click deploy actions.

## Run locally

```bash
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:4173`.

## Available scripts

```bash
npm run check
npm start
```

## Product flow

1. Verify token on the first screen.
2. Choose setup path.
3. Select a template to initialize bot configuration.
4. Use the dashboard to run sandbox tests and deploy updates.

## Design principles

- Monochrome visuals with soft-dot texture.
- Generous spacing and focused single-task panels.
- No clutter and no hidden menus.

Divergent removes friction while keeping control in your hands.
